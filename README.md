# Twitch API Streamers
Site that displays certain Twitch channels and let you know if they are broadcasting and shows their status. I used the Twitch API to retrieve the desired information by using the JSON Format returned from the Twitch API.

Twitch.tv API: https://github.com/justintv/Twitch-API

Programmed in HTML, CSS and Javascript.
